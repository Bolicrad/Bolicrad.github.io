No matter which role I performed in a game project, no matter how I get involved in the game project, no matter whether I code or not in the game project, I'm firstly a game developer. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in game engineering at the University of Utah's Entertainment Arts and Engineering , a fantastic video games graduate program. I create video games with many other talented designers, engineers, and artists here. What's my role in game development? Engineer: I work with various game engines. Unity, Unreal, Cocos Creator, Monogame, GameMaker, etc. Technology would never become a gap between me and fancy gameplays. Designer: I usually do the design works in collaboration, provide fancy ideas at the pre-production phase of game projects. Solo Game Developer: Why not sometimes make tiny games without a team? Though I still need to get access of free art assets. What if I want to do both? I can never find a better term to describe me other than \"Technical Game Designer.\" I always feel excited when I find some excellent new tools that might help build innovative gameplays. I'll always think about: Can I integrate this new tool into my current game projects? Could I find the best candidate to use this tool to create fancy content? Will it enhance the workflow to reduce unnecessary repeating works? If it has some weakness, can I refine it by modifying its source codes? Then I'd take steps to research, implement, apply, and refine those new tools. This cycle could help me in building game creation tools from designer's need. I feel happy when supporting aowsome game designers and cooperate closely with developers and artists. I understand that such position is still not abundant in the industry, so I'm also developing my design skill trees, with gameplay programming practices. If you are looking for a gameplay programmer or game designer, I'm still confident to be a candidate. To those who want to use video game as a method of communication: Sometimes I cooperate with people who aren't familiar with game creation, such as artists, musicians, social workers, or scientists. I utilize my technologies and methodogies of games to help them convey the experiences they wish, to the audience. I can cooperate with you if you're: An artist: You have fancy interactive ideas but lack an experienced developer to cooperate with; A social worker: You have a story about vulnerable groups to tell, but worrying about not being able to reach to audience in traditional media; A scientist: You want to show your science researches or popularize some science concepts to the public, to improve public understanding of science. I have a full skill set to help you create interactive projects, game or non-game, for your purpose. You can call those projects \"Serious Games\" as you wish, though I don't really like this term. My undergraduate direction was mass communication for science topics, and I have several such cross-disciplinary practices on file. Thank You for Reading I hope you can learn some aspects of me from those words.

I tried to develop a jump system in a 2d platformer setting, majorly because I want to learn the creation of a 2d platformer character, including its coding, as well as the animator state machine and the animations by frame. Character part in the ReTrieve project is mainly developed by my friend Daemon Pan, so I still want to discover my potential to finish such a game by myself. The double jump mechanic is well profiled and it's nice to have a try. The scoring of this game somehow refelcts the modern China history. Route of Industrialization by Bolicradar b) Stinky Snake Role: Solo Game Developer Period: Februray 1st 2022 Engine: Unity Special: EXTREMELY STINKY. You will like it. Third coursework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" course, with the theme \"Legacy Game\", which means you need to leave some eternal change to the game space across multiple game sessions. This title rethinks the relationship between we human and the influence we made to the environment, and tried to explore what potential effects the \"eternal legacy\" would provide to us, in an irony way. Developed in exactly one day and have just art/audio assets outsourced. Stinky Snake by Bolicradar c) True Fisrt Person Demo in Unreal Role: Solo Developer Period: Feburay 8th 2022 Engine: Unreal This tech demo is a cousework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" Course. The theme \"Melodramtic\" inspired me to create an experience that players are in true first person vision, to take a shower and cleaning body. Alothough the gameplay was not made in any speaking, at least I tried to made the camera binded to the head of the avatars' skeleton, and created the control of the avatar's neck and head with mouse, seperate with the control of movement. I majorly referenced this article , using aim offset system in unreal, but also profiled the function and removed the necessity of C++ codes. It works perfectly with just Blueprint. The potential of this system in gameplay is to enhance the sense of existence of yourself in the world, but also have distinct experience with normal FPS and VR games. In multiplayer games, players can see each others neck move fluently, which is absolutely a novel experience. Updated playables will be posted here after final debug & build. d) Fruit Bar Role: Solo Game Developer Period: One Week in late Februray 2022 Engine: Cocos Creater Sixth coursework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" course, with the theme \"Match-3 with Twisted Gameplay\". As match-3 is majorly ditrbuted on smart phones, I chose cocos creater to create more mobile friendly experience. The twist on traditional match-3 gameplay is \"Rotation\", as you can see in the video. When you use a mobile device to play this game, the direction friuts falling down will change if you rotate your device. With this new mechanic, you can even rotate the game in certain timing to achieve higher combos. It become popular in some of my friends and should be a novel experience. Fruit Bar by Bolicradar 4. Tech Demos & Prototypes a) Crow Platformer Demo Role: Gameplay Programmer Period: Summer 2022 Engine: Cocos Creator (for HTML5 export Only) Special: Made detailed researh on Spine and Web Gamepad API This tech demo is a new tryout for providing more precise charater controll system on the web platform for platformer games. With the Web Gamepad API, players can control the crow with any gamepad they have, with analog input from the joystick. It also revealed a cross platform game developing potential as we can pack the web game with Electron or Tauri for PC/Mac without losing controller support. CrowCrow by Bolicradar b) Tele-Rang Role: Technical Designer and Gameplay Programmer Period: 2 Weeks, August 2021- September 2021 Engine: Monogame Special: First Prototype in EAE Rapid Prototype Course, Ranked Top 3 in peer voting. This prototype was required to design around a toy boomerang (toy varies among teams). I researched the engines that was allowed and made decision for the team to use Monogame. I explored and inplemented the Monogame.Extended library to the project files, and helped the programmer to finish many features such as animation state machine, movement algorithm, game cycle logics. I also helped producer in pitching for operating the live demo because I was the only one in the team who could pass the hard level. Check out project files on Google Drive c) Inky_Stone Role: Solo Developer Period: Two weeks in November 2019 Engine: Cocos Creator This tech demo is a part of my work result in Dr.Stone Popular Science Studio. The students in earth and space science intended to make some physics-based minigames by themselves with cocos creator, and wanted to add a framework to for science-themed interactive dialouges. So I imported the ink.js library to the cocos proejct, and made a tech demo to excute the file exported from the inky editor , to empower the game team to create fun choices and questions. Inky_Stone by Bolicradar d) Interactive Comic Framework Role: Solo Developer Period: One week in Janurary 2021 Engine: Cocos Creator This tech demo is a part of my work result at Tantrum Network. Liangzhu was an interactive comic originated from an artist's student-era project made with Unity, and this start-up company wanted to port this project to a platform only support web-version game files. I then researched and developed the warping codes to directly import the psd files with certain layer hierarchy into cocos creator's object hierarchy, and transform them into working interactable comic automaticly. Based on the Baum.js Photoshop plugin and Baum2CocosCreator library. Also added motion frames and interactable choices. Try the live demo on gitee.io 5. Legacy Projects a) Heist-N-Heat Infinite Role: UI Developer & Producer Period: November 2021 - December 2021 Engine: Unreal (UMG/Blueprint) Special: My final project in the MEAE Rapid Prototype Course. This project is an race game that players drives a crazy car in the cit collecting treasure and fuel, avoiding the cop's chase. The highlight is that we have the twitch integration that twitch watcher could use command to produce obstacle or boosters for the player when streaming. I joined the project in the mid-phase and took over the UI function remake, 2D/UI art asset management, as well as technology research works on twitch API. Heist N' Heat: Infinite by Foursay b) Grassland Guardian Role: Solo Game Developer Period: Originated in May 2019, developed from December 2019 to June 2020 Engine: Unity (Original Prototype) & Cocos Creator (Publish Version) Special: Serious Game connected with my thesis project for bachelor's degree This game originated in a hackathon intended to help an NGO enhance its public communication. The NGO has worked on grassland protection and fought against desertification for several years in Northeastern China. I brought up a serious game plan to show their difficulty and finished a prototype within 24 hours. Later, I remade this project into an applet-based game and completed my thesis based on this game's development process and communication effect research. Grassland Guardian by Bolicradar c) Trick Role: Game Designer & Gameplay programmer Period: a Week in Janurary 2019 Engine: Unity Special: My first game prototype cooperated with experienced teammates. This prototype is my fisrt piece of work in video game, cooperated with two other experienced programmers and three student artists. For design, I brought up the idea of asymmetric local multiplayer, that one player control the hero with keyboard and the other control the demon king with mouse to trigger the traps. For engineering, I focused on the algorithm of the traps' movement and enemies' logic (especially the creppy flies). I also finished half of the level design, by creating level prefab with the object brush provided by my teammate. Trick by Bolicrad, MKK.kkkk, hch12hhh, BloodyOrchidDC, Hikari cat d) Trash Truck Role: Solo Game Developer Period: March-May 2019 Engine: Unity Special: Serious Game, won my undergraduate university's Energy Saving creation award.

No matter which role I performed in a game project, no matter how I get involved in the game project, no matter whether I code or not in the game project, I'm firstly a game developer. I'm currently pursuing a master's degree in game engineering at the University of Utah's Entertainment Arts and Engineering , a fantastic video games graduate program. I create video games with many other talented designers, engineers, and artists here. What's my role in game development? Engineer: I work with various game engines. Unity, Unreal, Cocos Creator, Monogame, GameMaker, etc. Technology would never become a gap between me and fancy gameplays. Designer: I usually do the design works in collaboration, provide fancy ideas at the pre-production phase of game projects. Solo Game Developer: Why not sometimes make tiny games without a team? Though I still need to get access of free art assets. What if I want to do both? I can never find a better term to describe me other than \"Technical Game Designer.\" I always feel excited when I find some excellent new tools that might help build innovative gameplays. I'll always think about: Can I integrate this new tool into my current game projects? Could I find the best candidate to use this tool to create fancy content? Will it enhance the workflow to reduce unnecessary repeating works? If it has some weakness, can I refine it by modifying its source codes? Then I'd take steps to research, implement, apply, and refine those new tools. This cycle could help me in building game creation tools from designer's need. I feel happy when supporting aowsome game designers and cooperate closely with developers and artists. I understand that such position is still not abundant in the industry, so I'm also developing my design skill trees, with gameplay programming practices. If you are looking for a gameplay programmer or game designer, I'm still confident to be a candidate. To those who want to use video game as a method of communication: Sometimes I cooperate with people who aren't familiar with game creation, such as artists, musicians, social workers, or scientists. I utilize my technologies and methodogies of games to help them convey the experiences they wish, to the audience. I can cooperate with you if you're: An artist: You have fancy interactive ideas but lack an experienced developer to cooperate with; A social worker: You have a story about vulnerable groups to tell, but worrying about not being able to reach to audience in traditional media; A scientist: You want to show your science researches or popularize some science concepts to the public, to improve public understanding of science. I have a full skill set to help you create interactive projects, game or non-game, for your purpose. You can call those projects \"Serious Games\" as you wish, though I don't really like this term. My undergraduate direction was mass communication for science topics, and I have several such cross-disciplinary practices on file. Thank You for Reading I hope you can learn some aspects of me from those words.

Major Projects 1. WhaleFall Haven 2. Vacuum War 3. Project Haiku 4. ReTrieve 5. Bouncy Strike B. \u201cExperimental Gameplay\u201d courseworks a) Route of Industilization Role: Solo Game Developer Period: One week in Janurary 2022 Engine: Unity This game is the first cousework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" course, with the theme \"Futurism\". I tried to develop a jump system in a 2d platformer setting, majorly because I want to learn the creation of a 2d platformer character, including its coding, as well as the animator state machine and the animations by frame. Character part in the ReTrieve project is mainly developed by my friend Daemon Pan, so I still want to discover my potential to finish such a game by myself. The double jump mechanic is well profiled and it's nice to have a try. The scoring of this game somehow refelcts the modern China history. Route of Industrialization by Bolicradar b) Stinky Snake Role: Solo Game Developer Period: Februray 1st 2022 Engine: Unity Special: EXTREMELY STINKY. You will like it. Third coursework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" course, with the theme \"Legacy Game\", which means you need to leave some eternal change to the game space across multiple game sessions. This title rethinks the relationship between we human and the influence we made to the environment, and tried to explore what potential effects the \"eternal legacy\" would provide to us, in an irony way. Developed in exactly one day and have just art/audio assets outsourced. Stinky Snake by Bolicradar c) True Fisrt Person Demo in Unreal Role: Solo Developer Period: Feburay 8th 2022 Engine: Unreal This tech demo is a cousework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" Course. The theme \"Melodramtic\" inspired me to create an experience that players are in true first person vision, to take a shower and cleaning body. Alothough the gameplay was not made in any speaking, at least I tried to made the camera binded to the head of the avatars' skeleton, and created the control of the avatar's neck and head with mouse, seperate with the control of movement. I majorly referenced this article , using aim offset system in unreal, but also profiled the function and removed the necessity of C++ codes. It works perfectly with just Blueprint. The potential of this system in gameplay is to enhance the sense of existence of yourself in the world, but also have distinct experience with normal FPS and VR games. In multiplayer games, players can see each others neck move fluently, which is absolutely a novel experience. Updated playables will be posted here after final debug & build. d) Fruit Bar Role: Solo Game Developer Period: One Week in late Februray 2022 Engine: Cocos Creater Sixth coursework of the \"Experimental Gameplay\" course, with the theme \"Match-3 with Twisted Gameplay\". As match-3 is majorly ditrbuted on smart phones, I chose cocos creater to create more mobile friendly experience. The twist on traditional match-3 gameplay is \"Rotation\", as you can see in the video. When you use a mobile device to play this game, the direction friuts falling down will change if you rotate your device. With this new mechanic, you can even rotate the game in certain timing to achieve higher combos. It become popular in some of my friends and should be a novel experience. Fruit Bar by Bolicradar 4. Tech Demos & Prototypes a) Crow Platformer Demo Role: Gameplay Programmer Period: Summer 2022 Engine: Cocos Creator (for HTML5 export Only) Special: Made detailed researh on Spine and Web Gamepad API This tech demo is a new tryout for providing more precise charater controll system on the web platform for platformer games. With the Web Gamepad API, players can control the crow with any gamepad they have, with analog input from the joystick. It also revealed a cross platform game developing potential as we can pack the web game with Electron or Tauri for PC/Mac without losing controller support. CrowCrow by Bolicradar b) Tele-Rang Role: Technical Designer and Gameplay Programmer Period: 2 Weeks, August 2021- September 2021 Engine: Monogame Special: First Prototype in EAE Rapid Prototype Course, Ranked Top 3 in peer voting. This prototype was required to design around a toy boomerang (toy varies among teams). I researched the engines that was allowed and made decision for the team to use Monogame. I explored and inplemented the Monogame.Extended library to the project files, and helped the programmer to finish many features such as animation state machine, movement algorithm, game cycle logics. I also helped producer in pitching for operating the live demo because I was the only one in the team who could pass the hard level. Check out project files on Google Drive c) Inky_Stone Role: Solo Developer Period: Two weeks in November 2019 Engine: Cocos Creator This tech demo is a part of my work result in Dr.Stone Popular Science Studio. The students in earth and space science intended to make some physics-based minigames by themselves with cocos creator, and wanted to add a framework to for science-themed interactive dialouges. So I imported the ink.js library to the cocos proejct, and made a tech demo to excute the file exported from the inky editor , to empower the game team to create fun choices and questions. Inky_Stone by Bolicradar d) Interactive Comic Framework Role: Solo Developer Period: One week in Janurary 2021 Engine: Cocos Creator This tech demo is a part of my work result at Tantrum Network. Liangzhu was an interactive comic originated from an artist's student-era project made with Unity, and this start-up company wanted to port this project to a platform only support web-version game files. I then researched and developed the warping codes to directly import the psd files with certain layer hierarchy into cocos creator's object hierarchy, and transform them into working interactable comic automaticly. Based on the Baum.js Photoshop plugin and Baum2CocosCreator library. Also added motion frames and interactable choices. Try the live demo on gitee.io 5. Legacy Projects a) Heist-N-Heat Infinite Role: UI Developer & Producer Period: November 2021 - December 2021 Engine: Unreal (UMG/Blueprint) Special: My final project in the MEAE Rapid Prototype Course. This project is an race game that players drives a crazy car in the cit collecting treasure and fuel, avoiding the cop's chase. The highlight is that we have the twitch integration that twitch watcher could use command to produce obstacle or boosters for the player when streaming. I joined the project in the mid-phase and took over the UI function remake, 2D/UI art asset management, as well as technology research works on twitch API. Heist N' Heat: Infinite by Foursay b) Grassland Guardian Role: Solo Game Developer Period: Originated in May 2019, developed from December 2019 to June 2020 Engine: Unity (Original Prototype) & Cocos Creator (Publish Version) Special: Serious Game connected with my thesis project for bachelor's degree This game originated in a hackathon intended to help an NGO enhance its public communication. The NGO has worked on grassland protection and fought against desertification for several years in Northeastern China. I brought up a serious game plan to show their difficulty and finished a prototype within 24 hours. Later, I remade this project into an applet-based game and completed my thesis based on this game's development process and communication effect research. Grassland Guardian by Bolicradar c) Trick Role: Game Designer & Gameplay programmer Period: a Week in Janurary 2019 Engine: Unity Special: My first game prototype cooperated with experienced teammates. This prototype is my fisrt piece of work in video game, cooperated with two other experienced programmers and three student artists. For design, I brought up the idea of asymmetric local multiplayer, that one player control the hero with keyboard and the other control the demon king with mouse to trigger the traps. For engineering, I focused on the algorithm of the traps' movement and enemies' logic (especially the creppy flies). I also finished half of the level design, by creating level prefab with the object brush provided by my teammate. Trick by Bolicrad, MKK.kkkk, hch12hhh, BloodyOrchidDC, Hikari cat d) Trash Truck Role: Solo Game Developer Period: March-May 2019 Engine: Unity Special: Serious Game, won my undergraduate university's Energy Saving creation award. This is a serious game themed on trash categorizing and recycling, intended to educate kids to learn how to throw the trash into correct kind of trashcan to help the socitey to deal with recycling better.
